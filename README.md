## Alphabet Soup Chairty Project

## Overview
I've created a model for the Alphabet Soup foundation, it will help to select applicants for funding with the best optimizes chance of success. Using neural networks, I have used the  provided dataset to create a model that can predict whether the applicants will be successful funded by Alphabet Soup. We were set a target of 75% accuracy for our model.

## Results
### Data Processing
This model designed to predict applicant success once funded. I have set the tagered variable as the `IS_SUCCESSFUL` columns in the database.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
